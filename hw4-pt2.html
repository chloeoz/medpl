   Nesrine Malik: AI Slop
  </head>
  <p>Nesrine Malik discusses the impact of AI on our consumption and perception of information, referring to this rapid spread of AI-generated content as “AI slop.” Malik defines AI slop as content that copies real information but without authenticity, such as AI-generated images and posts that spread online, saturating digital spaces. It’s interesting to note the significant cultural and cognitive shifts happening with the rise in the quantity of low-quality digital output in an era of doomscrolling, dopamine hits, and our shrinking attention spans. This constant cycle of psychological patterns of modern media use enabled the growth of AI, where speed and volume mattered more than accuracy or depth. When individuals are too distracted to recognize or care that they are misinformed, the algorithm prioritizes engagement over accuracy since “content is content” by overwhelming users with so much content that distinguishing the truth becomes exhausting. This culture of overconsumption and constant stimulation reinforces the spread of AI slop with people’s desire for quick answers and a simplified narrative, resulting in individuals being more susceptible to misinformation. This point becomes especially obvious when looking at the popularity of short-form videos on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels. There are thousands of clips that supposedly explain complex history or film summaries in under a minute, which often rely on oversimplification or sometimes misrepresentation that ultimately limit our understanding of history, art, and culture. The combination of rapid AI development, unchecked consumption, and shortened attention spans creates a space where AI-generated materials circulate widely. The normalization of misinformation occurs simply because it becomes familiar.</p>
