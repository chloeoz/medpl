   Susan Sontag, In Plato’s Cave from the book: On Photography
  </head>
<p>Susan Sontag connects the philosophy of Plato’s allegory of the cave to one’s perspectives on photographs. I liked her argument that photographs create only a partial illusion of the truth, never capturing the full event or the totality of experience. Similar to the cave dwellers in Plato’s allegory, learning and understanding require personal engagement and experience, which I also apply to my photography. I need to bring my own emotions and perspectives to make sense of image making. Sontag points out that photography differs from other art forms because it gives the guise of being mediated. This selective quality is especially relevant today with the oversaturation of images and commodification of experiences. Likewise, I find myself on these same platforms curating photographs. I like paying attention to the color palette, composition, and the actual content for my grid. It was particularly popular in the late 2010s for social media users to post screencaps, which started my personal interest in photography through Studio Ghibli films and their storytelling. The images carried their own rhythm and mood, and seeing these photos spread made me think about how these visuals work, such as framing and color. I noticed the simple details, even in an animated film, such as the soft light and lingering shots, which created a more personal touch. From there, I started building a personal archive. It was initially unorganized, with pictures I liked or moments I wanted to hold onto, though my process has become more intentional, such as identifying which photos complement one another better and which compositions create balance. The art of curating these images feels like constructing a visual language. In this way, photography is a reflection of how fragments of my experience can be shaped into something physical, something that reflects how I see and how I continue to learn. </p>
