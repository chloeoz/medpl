<p>I use videography and visual culture to create projects that explore identity and self-expression drawing from the aesthetics of fashion and music. I capture these constantly shifting and evolving cultural movements by experimenting with layering sound, image, and mood across digital and physical spaces. My work uses style and sound to create a space where fashion, music, and film intersect through rhythmic editing that mirrors the musical composition and choreographed spontaneity that embraces visual storytelling. My projects aim to translate contemporary culture into personal experiences where the interaction of visual media channels emotion and narrative. My goal is to create original works that experiment with visuals and sound. </p> a</p>
