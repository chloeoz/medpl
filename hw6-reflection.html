<p>The illustrations in Birth in My Village remind me of many Webtoon works that guide readers through a story panel by panel. This visual style offers smaller and more intimate moments that allow readers to experience the character’s inner world rather than simply relying on photographs. The scenes in each panel feel carefully paced, giving the viewer time to process what she might be feeling. Each illustration helped me feel more with her through the pacing, mood, and expression, allowing me to sense her fear and hope throughout the story. I also noticed how the art sometimes drew more attention to details like her expression and the quiet tension through her surrounding landscape, which makes her world feel more alive and personal. This approach allows for a more authentic flow compared to photography that relies on a single fixed moment or a text that explains her story.</p>
